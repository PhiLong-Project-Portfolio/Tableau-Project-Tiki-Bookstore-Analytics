# Tiki Bookstore Analytics Using Tableau

### Introduction
Tiki is one of Vietnam's leading retail e-commerce platforms, renowned for offering a wide range of official products, coupled with a seamless and rapid shopping experience. With its vast inventory and extensive seller network, Tiki has established itself as a trusted destination for millions of customers.

### About my project
In this project, I focused on analyzing data from Tiki's bookstore segment. The data was collected directly from Tiki’s platform through a web scraping process using Python. The dataset includes detailed information on books information, categorization of books, seller performance, and customer ratings.

After extracting the data, I utilized Microsoft Excel to clean and organize the raw dataset, eliminating inconsistencies and preparing it for analyzing. The cleaned data was then imported into Tableau, where I designed a series of visualizations to provide a comprehensive overview of Tiki's bookstore performance. These visualizations highlight key insights, such as inventory availability by category, the dominance of top sellers, and customer satisfaction metrics, offering a clear view of the platform's strengths and areas for improvement.

The project includes two main sections:

- **Tiki Bookstore Overview:** provide overview information, such as the distribution of inventory by category, the market share of best-selling products, and customer review scores, giving a detailed perspective on the platform's effectiveness and areas that may need attention.

### Key Findings
- **Key Product Categories and Leading Sellers:** The analysis showed a significant concentration in product categories such as "Sách Văn Học" and "Sách Kỹ Năng Sống," with Tiki Trading being the primary vendor. This highlights the strategic focus of Tiki on these categories and sellers.

- **Seller Distribution:** The data indicated that a small percentage of sellers contribute the majority of sales, which could suggest the need for strategies to empower smaller sellers or optimize the performance of underrepresented categories.

- **Customer Satisfaction:** With over 98% of the books rated 4 stars and above, only 0.28% of books are rated 2 stars or lower, and 0.88% of reviews are 1-star ratings. It indicates that customers are generally very satisfied with the books they purchase from Tiki Bookstore, which is a positive indicator of the store's product quality and customer service.

### Conclusion
Through this project, I aimed to deliver a data-driven understanding of Tiki’s bookstore operations. It also gave me a deeper understanding of the e-commerce landscape in Vietnam, particularly within the context of a leading platform like Tiki.

However, one limitation of the project is that this project may not capture the full of Tiki’s operations. Additionally, the analysis focused primarily on the bookstore segment, so the findings might not be fully generalizable to other product categories on Tiki.
